- `bandit.ipynb`: the notebook version of `bandit_run.py`

- `train.py` and `dataset.py`: modules for model training and data loading.

- `check_bandit_results.ipynb`: evaluating bandit selection models on test sets.
- `bandit_vis.Rmd`: visualizing bandit selection results.

Preparation for dataset and environment

- `pilot.sub` and `pilot.sh`: submit file and bash script for checking environment on CHTC.
- `pilot_run.py`: main script to run a pilot model.
- `pilot_run.ipynb`: the notebook version of `pilot_run.py`.
- `location_eurosat.ipynb`: notebook to extract location information from the original dataset.

Checking dataset and debugging

- `check_labels.ipynb`: checks labels across countries.
